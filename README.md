# Automatic Sentence Division

This project aims to split complex sentences into its simple parts. This will enable other components to be more accurate analysing simple sentences instead of a big complex sentence. To be able to do this with any sentence, a neural network was chosen to perform such task. An example use case is to split commands supplied by [RoboCup's command generator](https://github.com/kyordhel/GPSRCmdGen) to perform such task.
